# Fetch Button Interview Challenge

Please develop a simple web page that contains a button, that when clicked, makes a call to a REST endpoint to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, the page should display the data on the page in a table or div or span, etc.

## Technical requirements

- You can use either javascript or React
- The page just needs to run on a local environment (no need to deploy it to a hosted server)
- The page should not reload to display the data - it should be injected directly on the page after the call returns
- You can use an REST API to get the data. [Here are some random free ones you can call](https://apipheny.io/free-api/).
- You're welcome to write your own REST endpoint, but that is not required.
- Apply some css styling to the button page. We're not looking for a master piece, but rather some rudimentary styling.
